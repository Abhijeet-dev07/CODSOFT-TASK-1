# CODSOFT-TASK-1
NUMBER GUESSING GAME.
In this program, I have imported a Random variable from the util package and also imported a Scanner Class.
After that in the main class, I created a random object to get a Random integer input from the system.
Then I created  Variables to give a default of minimum range, maximum range, max attempts, and a score variable to keep adding up the score.
Used some iterative conditions and printed the outputs.
